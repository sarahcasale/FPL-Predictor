    "# 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to enable Fantasty Premier League players to better analyze the performance of players and therefore be able to make a more informed decision about which players they should buy, hold, or sell throughout the course of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each matchweek each participant will field a squad of players that they feel will bring in the most points during their matches. The score of each player depends on both their performance and their position. The following is the breakdown of the scoring by the Fantasty Premier League website:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All players receive points for the following:\n",
    "    - (1) Point for playing up to 60 minutes.\n",
    "    - (2) Points for playing 60 minutes or more (excluding stoppage time).\n",
    "    - (3) Points for each goal assist.\n",
    "    - (-2) Points for each penalty miss.\n",
    "    - (1-3) Bonus Points for the best rated players in the match.\n",
    "    - (-1) Points for each yellow card received.\n",
    "    - (-3) Points for each red card receieved.\n",
    "    - (-2) Points for each own goal scored.\n",
    "- Goalkeepers receive points for the following:\n",
    "    - (6) Points for scoring a goal.\n",
    "    - (4) Points for a clean sheet.\n",
    "    - (1) Points for every 3 shots saved.\n",
    "    - (5) Points for each penalty save.\n",
    "    - (-1) Points for every 2 goals conceded.\n",
    "- Defenders receive points for the following:\n",
    "    - (6) Points for scoring a goal.\n",
    "    - (4) Points for a clean sheet.\n",
    "    - (-1) Points for every 2 goals conceded.\n",
    "- Midfielders receive points for the following:\n",
    "    - (5) Points for scoring a goal.\n",
    "    - (1) Points for a clean sheet.\n",
    "- Forwards recieve points for the following:\n",
    "    - (4) Points for scoring a goal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Participants of the Fantasty Premier League must field a team against different players every week in the hopes to win a grand prize at the end of the season. Each matchweek, Fantasty players spend a lot of time trying to find and analyze statistics in order to make an educated decision as to which players on their squad will perform the best.\n",

    "This project not only provides players access to better statistics, it also allows them to efficiently analyze the data that they're given with a predicted performance score that will allow them to make faster decisions. It also allows them to compare various players against one another, as well as taking a player's opponent difficulty into account, in order to make a long-term strategy for their squad."

    "1. Does the position of the player effect how many points they receive?\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis: The position of the player doesn't effect how many points that they are able to receive in a given matchweek.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis: The position of the player does effect how many points that they are able to receieve in a given matchweek.\n",
    "2. Does the difficultly level of the player's opponent team that week effect the value of the points they are able to achieve?\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis: The difficulty level of the player's opponent team that week does not effect the value of the points they are able to achieve.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis: The difficulty level of the player's opponent team that week effects the value of the points they are able to achieve.\n",
    "3. Does performance outside of league play (International Competitions / Club Competitions) effect the player's value?\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis: The player's performance outside of league play does not effect the player's value.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 2. Method\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1 Data Acquisition**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our data was obtained from a github user who scraped the premier league fantasy website between the years 2016 and 2020 to get data on players for every game in that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The data we used was a compilation of hundreds of files made by this user into one dataframe\n",
    "https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - So we ran an algorithm to visit every file on github, and get the data and compile it together through code to obtain one giant database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once, put all together the dataset is 114803 rows Ã— 31 columns.\n",
    "  - Each row represents a players performance from one game. There are 5 different seasons in the dataset and 38 games for each season. This means there are about 600 players per season.\n",
    "  - Each column represents a statistic from one game. For example, it could be number of goals or assist, or minutes played, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Later, we add on our own custom columns which shows trend and form\n",
    "  - The trend and form columns are the ones we will use to predict a players score for an upcoming game.\n",
    "  - trend is the average of the slope between the last 4 games\n",
    "for example, if a player scores 3 goals, then 2, then 0, then 2, their trend is -.333\n",
    "  - form is the average over the last 4 games\n",
    "with the same example, if a player scores 3 goals, then 2, then 0, then 2, their form is 1.75\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2 Data Analysis**\n",
    "- With our model, we are trying to predict the total points that a player will score in the upcoming week based on past performances\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The model will base its predictions on all of the calculated trend and form columns, whether its a home game, and the opponent\n",
    "  - Those are the most important becuase form is often a very good predictor of how a player will do, and the home field advantage is very important in spots. \n",
    "  - Also the a good opponent will obviously lower the points compared to a bad opponent\n",
    "this is a supervised ML problem because we have labeled data. \n",
    "  - It is regression, becuase we are trying to predict the number of points a player will score, not classify them into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After testing Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, KNeighborsRegressor, and LinearSVR, we determined that Linear Regression Produced the best results. We also used train_test_split, MinMaxScaler, and RFE with a DecisionTreeRegressor. We decided to use each of these because each of them fit the type of model we wanted and improved our test r2 scores over other algorithms"

    "- Gameweek: The week of a season in which a game is played\n",
    "- Assists: How many assists a player gave\n",
    "- Big Chances Created: How many big chances a player created, more big chances indicates more luck with assists and goals in future\n",

Players with no positions were not analyzed due to leass information available.\n",
    "- We applied a lot of functions to clean up the data, remove columns and add positions to every player record.\n",

    "* For ML, we used 4 specific algorithms, Linear Regression, Ridge, Knn, and Lasso. \n",
    "* From these specific algorithms, In all categories there was minor difeerence between linear regression and and ridge - however Linear regression seemed to have the slight edge in terms of the best performing algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature selection led to a small increase in the performance (less that 1%) \n",
    "    - each position had a different amount of features to produce the best results\n",
    "    - e.g. the goalkeeping model had 25 features selected, while the midfielders had 27 to produce the best results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We believe that our model is a good predictor for our outcome variable of toal points. As all of our group members know from personal experience, predicting who is going to do best in the unpredictable world of soccer is very difficult. Being able to pick the best team with avg 25% accuracy is very impressive, and can certainly be used as a tool for any fantasy sports users\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We all felt that the accuracy of the model was very low partially due to unknown data for a lot of the players, furthermore since the sport is unpredictable, due to injuries, game bans ,and player fitness - finding a way to incorporate the news could help us imporve the accuracy. On top of that, player form naturally goes up and down, just because a player scores 3 goals in one game, that certainly doesnt mean they will score even one in the next. In the future, obtaining better data and a way to incorporate more external factors (data not taken within the game, ie. injury record, team rotations, etc.) data could be helpful in understanding and predicting better. Often, teams will put out before a game is played whether or not a player will be playing at all, this would be key in improving our standings. Game frequency also has a large impact on performance. 90 minuted of running is tiring for players, so teams with a week of rest will often outplay teams with 3 days of rest simply because of that factor. With so many variables in the world of sports, there are many other things to include that would only improve our model"
