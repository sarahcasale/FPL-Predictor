# FPL-Predictor
Fantasy Premier League Team Predictor

The purpose of this project is to enable Fantasty Premier League players to better analyze the performance of players and therefore be able to make a more informed decision about which players they should buy, hold, or sell throughout the course of the season.

During each matchweek each participant will field a squad of players that they feel will bring in the most points during their matches. The score of each player depends on both their performance and their position. The following is the breakdown of the scoring by the Fantasty Premier League website:

All players receive points for the following:
(1) Point for playing up to 60 minutes.
(2) Points for playing 60 minutes or more (excluding stoppage time).
(3) Points for each goal assist.
(-2) Points for each penalty miss.
(1-3) Bonus Points for the best rated players in the match.
(-1) Points for each yellow card received.
(-3) Points for each red card receieved.
(-2) Points for each own goal scored.
Goalkeepers receive points for the following:
(6) Points for scoring a goal.
(4) Points for a clean sheet.
(1) Points for every 3 shots saved.
(5) Points for each penalty save.
(-1) Points for every 2 goals conceded.
Defenders receive points for the following:
(6) Points for scoring a goal.
(4) Points for a clean sheet.
(-1) Points for every 2 goals conceded.
Midfielders receive points for the following:
(5) Points for scoring a goal.
(1) Points for a clean sheet.
Forwards recieve points for the following:
(4) Points for scoring a goal.
Our project identifies the best potential players for each matchweek by analyzing their position and their previous performance record.

This project not only provides players access to better statistics, it also allows them to efficiently analyze the data that they're given with a predicted performance score that will allow them to make faster decisions. It also allows them to compare various players against one another, as well as taking a player's opponent difficulty into account, in order to make a long-term strategy for their squad.
